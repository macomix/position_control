# Project Repository README

This repository is part of a university project and is based on [original repository link](https://github.com/original-repo](https://github.com/FormulasAndVehicles/position_control_template) with certain modifications and additions.

## Overview

This project focuses on the implementation of an extended Kalman filter for the evaluation of AprilTags for position data. It also includes functions for controlling a BlueROV with a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller.

The most important functions in this project are:

- **Extended Kalman Filter:** Utilizes AprilTags for accurate positioning data by employing an Extended Kalman filter.
- **PID Controller:** Implements a PID controller to control a BlueROV in a water tank.

### Repository Structure

- `/nodes`: Contains the main scripts and executable files.
